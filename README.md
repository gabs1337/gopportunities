# Go Opportunities API

This project uses the powerfull language for API built called Golang and follows a modern structure.    

---

## Features

- Introduction to Golang and building modern APIs
- Development environment setup for creating the API
- Using Go-Gin as a router for route management
- Implementing SQLite as the database for the API
- Using GoORM for communication with the database
- Integrating Swagger for API documentation and testing
- Creating a modern package structure for organizing the project
- Implementing a complete job opportunities API with endpoints for searching, creating, editing, and deleting opportunities
- Implementing automated tests to ensure API quality


## Used Tools

This project uses the following tools:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/) for backend development
- [Go-Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for route management
- [GoORM](https://gorm.io/) for database communication
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as the database
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation and testing

## Usage

After the API is running, you can use the Swagger UI to interact with the endpoints for searching, creating, editing, and deleting job opportunities. The API can be accessed at `http://localhost:$PORT/swagger/index.html`.

Default $PORT if not provided=8080.
